/**
\page fileCmd
!!!Attaching a comment block to a specific file ( file )
Indicates that a comment block contains documentation for a source or header file 
with name \<name\>. The file name may include (part of) the path if the file-name 
alone is not unique. If the file name is omitted (i.e. the line after \\file is left 
blank) then the documentation block that contains the \\file command will belong 
to the file it is located in.

DoxyS does not require you to document files in order to get any class, function 
variable etc. documentation shown in the output. The \\file-tag is only in case one 
do need to document a file. Most often what You really want in this case is to use 
a unit (unitCmd).

!Syntax
\code
\file [<filename>]
\endcode
!Output
The file command does not produce any output of its own, but secures that the 
comment block as a whole is used to produce the documentation of the specified file.
