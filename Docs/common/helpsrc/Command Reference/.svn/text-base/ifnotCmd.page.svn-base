!!!Starts a conditional documentation section ( ifnot ) 
The section is ended with a matching \endif command. To enable a conditional section, 
add the section-label to the ENABLED_SECTIONS (see Inputparsing) in the configuration 
file. Conditional blocks can be nested. Nested sections are only enabled if all 
parent level sections are enabled as well.
