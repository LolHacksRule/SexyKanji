!!! Attaching comment block to a specific class ( class )
The struct command is used to explicitly link a documentation comment block to the 
specified struct. The usage is identical to the \\class command (see classCmd).

/**
\struct SepDocStruct
Normal way of documenting goes here ....
\endds_doc \endcode
