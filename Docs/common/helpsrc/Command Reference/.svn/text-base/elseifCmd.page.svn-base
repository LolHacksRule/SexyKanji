/**
\page elseifCmd
!!!Else If clause of a conditional documentation section ( elseif ) 
Starts a conditional documentation section if the previous section was not enabled. 
A conditional section is disabled by default. To enable it you must put the section-label 
after the ENABLED_SECTIONS (see Inputparsing) in the configuration file. Conditional 
blocks can be nested. A nested section is only enabled if all enclosing sections 
are enabled as well.

\elseif Condition2
   This section is only included, if Condition2 is added to
   ENABLED_SECTIONS in the DoxySfile
\endif
\endcode
