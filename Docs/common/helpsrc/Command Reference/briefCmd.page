!!! Designating a brief description section ( brief )
The brief description should give a first one line introduction to what the symbol 
is or does. It is parsed from the beginning of the comment block description, until 
the first full stop or line break, see HowToDocument::BriefAndDescription. The 
brief description is shown on lists (class, function, overview etc.) to give a 
first introduction to the symbol.

! \\brief command (only use in rare cases) 
The brief command is used to override this behavior and explicitly define a brief 
description. It is }#NOT#} intended to be used except for rare cases.
!Syntax
\code
\brief This is a brief description which spans several lines
of text. It continues until a blank line or until a new section command is encountered

So this is not part of the brief description....
\endcode
!Output
See HowToDocument::BriefCmd

\include section_commands.inc
\note This command is mainly provided for compatibility with Doxygen or in the 
      rare cases where you for some reason }need} to span the brief over several 
      lines.
