!!! Forcing a newline without using a blank line( \n )
To force a newline without having to insert a blank line use $\\n$. 
This can now also be achieved by setting ENABLE_HARD_SOFT_LINE_BREAKS = YES 
and then make linebreak without any spaces before the linebreak. I.e. simply 
press "enter" right after the last character on the line to force a line break. 
If on the other hand you insert a space after the last charater and before the 
linebreak no linebreak will occur in the output.

!Syntax
\code
Some text with a line break here\n
next line continues here.
\endcode
!Output
Some text with a line break here\n
next line continues here.
