!!! Adding a call graph ( callgraph )
If the HAVE_DOT parameter is set to YES in the DoxySfile, this command will cause 
a call graph to be generated for the function (provided the implementation of the 
function or method calls other documented functions). The command can be added 
anywhere in the documentation block for a function.
!Syntax
\code
/** Brief description of function. More .....
\callgraph 
\endds_doc \endcode
!Output
A callgraph tab is added to the function documentation.

\note The completeness (and correctness) of the call graph depends on the DoxyS code 
      parser which is not perfect.
