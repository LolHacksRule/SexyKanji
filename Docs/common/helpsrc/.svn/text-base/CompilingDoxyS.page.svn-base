!!! Compiling DoxyS

Download the source code from the download page and unzip it.

!Windows
Install python for windows http://www.python.org

In visual studio, open the 'doxys.sln', you can find it in doxys/wintools.
Start compiling ('Rebuild Solution' the first time). Due to a problem in the 
project file, that we haven't figured out yet, you will get a bunch of linker 
errors the first time you compile, unless you choose 'Rebuild Solution'. Hereafter
a normal build will do fine.
If you have any idea why this happens, please let us know, so we can fix it.

!Linux (Unix)
Download source code and unzip it.
-# Go to root of source code directory and run:
-# #sh configure --debug# or #sh configure --release#. 
-# Then just type #make# or perhaps open the KDevlop project file and build from
there.

You can also just run #./configure# but be sure that the script is executable first!
If not run #chmod a+x configure#.

Options for the 'configure' script. #configure -h#
By default it will compile in release, for debug #configure --debug#
