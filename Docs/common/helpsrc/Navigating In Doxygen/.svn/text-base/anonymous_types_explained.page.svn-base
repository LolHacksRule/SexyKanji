/** 
\page AnonymousTypes

!!Anonymous types in DoxyS.
Anonymous namepaces, classes, structs and unions are given artificial names
in the DoxyS documentation in order to better display them and to be able to 
distiguish between them.

The automatic generated names are a concatenation of a prefix, unique ID number
and the name of the surrounding scope like this:

||Syntax||Type||Example
|$AN$ + $NUM$ _+$file_name$| Anonymous #namespace#, usually in a .CPP-file| AN4_myfile.cpp
|$AU$ + $NUM$ _+$class_name$| Anonymous #union#, usually inside a class| AU8_MyClass
|$AC$ + $NUM$ _+$class_name$| Anonymous #class#, usually inside a class| AC12_MyClass
|$AS$ + $NUM$ _+$class_name$| Anonymous #struct#, usually inside a class| AS2_MyClass
