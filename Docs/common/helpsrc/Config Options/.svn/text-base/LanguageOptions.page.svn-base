/** \page LanguageOptions

!!! Language options.



||OUTPUT_LANGUAGE|The OUTPUT_LANGUAGE tag is used to specify the language in which all documentation generated by DoxyS is written. DoxyS will use this information to generate all constant output in the proper language. The default language is English, other supported languages are: Brazilian, Catalan, Chinese, Chinese-Traditional, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Japanese-en (Japanese with English messages), Korean, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Slovak, Slovene, Spanish, Swedish, and Ukrainian.\n #Default value:#\n $English$
||USE_WINDOWS_ENCODING|This tag can be used to specify the encoding used in the generated output. The encoding is not always determined by the language that is chosen, but also whether or not the output is meant for Windows or non-Windows users. In case there is a difference, setting the USE_WINDOWS_ENCODING tag to YES forces the Windows encoding (this is the default for the Windows binary), whereas setting the tag to NO uses a Unix-style encoding (the default for all platforms other than Windows).\n #Default value:#\n $YES$
