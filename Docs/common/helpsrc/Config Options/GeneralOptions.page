/** \page GeneralOptions

!!! General configuration options.

The general configuration options are those that most projects would want to adjust. 
The rest of the options will for most purposes work just fine with the default values. 


||PROJECT_NAME|The PROJECT_NAME tag is a single word (or a sequence of words surrounded by quotes) that should identify the project. \n #Default value:#\n $DefaultProjectName$
||PROJECT_NUMBER|The PROJECT_NUMBER tag can be used to enter a project or revision number. This could be handy for archiving the generated documentation or if some version control system is used.
||INPUT|The INPUT tag can be used to specify the files and/or directories that contain documented source files. You may enter file names like "myfile.cpp" or directories like "/usr/src/myproject". Separate the files or directories with spaces. \n #Default value:#\n $.$
||OUTPUT_DIRECTORY|The OUTPUT_DIRECTORY tag is used to specify the (relative or absolute) base path where the generated documentation will be put. If a relative path is entered, it will be relative to the location where DoxyS was started. If left blank 'doxys_doc' will be used.\n #Default value:#\n $doxys_docs/$
||GENERATE_DOXYS_HELP|If the GENERATE_DOXYS_HELP tag is set to YES, DoxyS will generate help pages for DoxyS itself along with to the project documentation \n #Default value:#\n $YES$
||HTML_FILE_EXTENSION|The HTML_FILE_EXTENSION tag can be used to specify the file extension for each generated HTML page (for example: .htm,.php,.asp). If it is left blank DoxyS will generate files with .html extension.\n #Default value:#\n $.html$
||CUSTOM_DIR|The CUSTOM_DIR tag is used to specify where the custom directory is. The custom directory is used to place a $#logo.gif#$, $#logo.jpg#$ or  $#logo.png#$. This logo file is used on all the pages. A style sheet file 'default.css' can be placed here if you want a different setup than the default.Run DoxyS, copy the style sheet file from the common dir and you are ready to go.
||SERVER_STATISTICS|The SERVER_STATISTICS tag is used to specify where the server statistics file is.If left blank, server statistics is turned off. To use server statistics, you will need a script on a server to collect the data from the static HTML pages. Script can be found at http://www.doxys.dk under Download.Make your own script and database.Make a database with these filds:Id, Definitiontype, Pagename, Pagetype, Projectname, Date, RequestpageA script that can receive these posted arguments:projectname, definitiontype, pagename, pagetypeand add the date and HTTP_REFERER your self when putting it all into the database.
||HTML_HELP_SERVER_PATH|The HTML_HELP_SERVER_PATH tag is used to specify where the root of theHTML files will be placed on the server. Used when generating XML-file for integration with MS.NET.
||STRIP_CODE_COMMENTS|Setting the STRIP_CODE_COMMENTS tag to YES (the default) will instruct DoxyS to hide any special comment blocks from generated source code fragments. Normal C and C++ comments will always remain visible. \n #Default value:#\n $YES$
