/** \page Formulas
!!! Including formulas
Doxygen allows you to put \f$ \mbox{LaTeX} \f$ formulas in the output. You will need to have the 
following tools installed:
- $latex$: The Latex compiler, needed to parse the formulas.
- $dvips$: A tool to convert DVI files to PostScript files.
- $gs$: The GhostScript interpreter for converting PostScript files to bitmaps.

!! Windows install
You can download the ProTeXt (http://www.tug.org/protext) package from 
http://mirrors.dotsrc.org/ctan/systems/windows/protext. 

You also need to make sure that #C:\\Program Files\\gs\\gs8.54\\bin# and 
#C:\\Program Files\\MiKTeX 2.5\\miktex\\bin# are in your $PATH$ variable. Note that 
your exact version numbers may vary. The important thing is that all 3 $latex.exe$ 
$dvips.exe$ $gswin32.exe$ are in your $PATH$. 

!! Examples

There are three ways to include formulas in the documentation.

1. Using in-text formulas that appear in the running text. These formulas should be put between a pair 
of #\\f\$# commands, so that

\code
The distance between \f$(x_1,y_1)\f$ and \f$(x_2,y_2)\f$ is: \f$\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2}\f$.
\endcode
results in:

The distance between \f$(x_1,y_1)\f$ and \f$(x_2,y_2)\f$ is: \f$\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2}\f$.

2. Unnumbered displayed formulas that are centered on a separate line. These formulas should be 
put between #\\f[# and #\\f]# commands. An example:
\code
\f[
  |I_2|=\left| \int_{0}^T \psi(t) 
            \left\{ 
              u(a,t)-
              \int_{\gamma(t)}^a 
              \frac{d\theta}{k(\theta,t)}
              \int_{a}^\theta c(\xi)u_t(\xi,t)\,d\xi
            \right\} dt
        \right|
\f]
\endcode
results in:

\f[
  |I_2|=\left| \int_{0}^T \psi(t) 
            \left\{ 
              u(a,t)-
              \int_{\gamma(t)}^a 
              \frac{d\theta}{k(\theta,t)}
              \int_{a}^\theta c(\xi)u_t(\xi,t)\,d\xi
            \right\} dt
        \right|
\f]

3. Formulas or other latex elements that are not in a math environment can be specified 
using #\\f\{environment\}#, where environment is the name of the Latex environment, 
the corresponding end command is #\\f\}#. Here is an example for an equation array
\code
\f{eqnarray*}
    g &=& \frac{Gm_2}{r^2} \\ 
      &=& \frac{(6.673 \times 10^{-11}\,\mbox{m}^3\,\mbox{kg}^{-1}\,
          \mbox{s}^{-2})(5.9736 \times 10^{24}\,\mbox{kg})}{(6371.01\,\mbox{km})^2} \\ 
      &=& 9.82066032\,\mbox{m/s}^2
\f}
\endcode
which results in:

\f{eqnarray*}
    g &=& \frac{Gm_2}{r^2} \\ 
      &=& \frac{(6.673 \times 10^{-11}\,\mbox{m}^3\,\mbox{kg}^{-1}\,
          \mbox{s}^{-2})(5.9736 \times 10^{24}\,\mbox{kg})}{(6371.01\,\mbox{km})^2} \\ 
      &=& 9.82066032\,\mbox{m/s}^2
\f}

For the first two commands one should make sure formulas contain valid commands in Latex's math-mode. For the 
third command the section should contain valid command for the specific environment.

!Warning:
Currently, DoxyS is not very fault tolerant in recovering from typos in formulas. It may 
be necessary to remove the file $doxys_formulas/formula.repository$ that is written to 
the html directory to get rid of an incorrect formula.
