/** \page "Text Formatting"
!!! Formatting text in wiki-like syntax
DoxyS features a wiki-like textparser enabling the user to create nice formatted 
HTML pages using plain text files, while still keeping the original textfile easily 
readable. The formatting options include:\n
headlines, lists, tables, boxes, lines, code formatting, #bold#, }italics}, {underlined{ text.

!! Headlines
Headlines are produced by starting a line with one to three exclamation marks:
\code
!!!Headline BIG
!!Headline Medium 
!Headline small
\endcode

Will produce:\n
!!!Headline BIG
!!Headline Medium
!Headline small

Additional formatting within a headline is not possible since it's appearance is 
taken from the stylesheet.

!! Typeface formatting
Enclosing one or more words in chars: $ \#, \}, \{, \$ $ works like this:

|| \#bold text\# | #bold text# 
|| \}italic text\} | }italic text} 
|| \{underlined text\{ | {underlined text{  
|| \$monospaced text\$ | $monospaced text$ 
|| \{\#\}Combination\{\#\} | {#}Combination{#}

!!Bulleted lists
Bulleted lists may be produced by starting lines with a dash and a white space $'- '$:

\code
- First item
- Second item spanning several lines because this text is just som damn long that
  it goes on and on and on. It even continues here after a full stop making it an 
  indeed veeeery long bulleted text.
- Third item
  - First subitem
  - Second subitem
\endcode

Will produce:

- First item
- Second item spanning several lines because this text is just som damn long that
  it goes on and on and on. It even continues here after a full stop making it an 
  indeed veeeery long bulleted text.

!! Numbered bulleted lists
Numbered lists may be produced by starting lines with a dash, hashmark and a whitespace $'-\# '$:

\code

-# Third item
  -# First subitem
  -# Second subitem
-# Fourth item

the beginning of a table cell. Two pipe signs indicate the beginning of a header cell.
