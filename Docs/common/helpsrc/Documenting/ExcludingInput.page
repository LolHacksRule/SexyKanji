!!! Excluding certain input (DoxyS.ignore, DOXYS_OFF, exclude)
To facilitate cutomisation of what's included in the generated output DoxyS supports 
ways of excluding files, sections of files or individual entities.

! Excluding files (DoxyS.ignore)
This works similar the CVS counterpart $.cvsignore$ file except that currently 
the $DoxyS.ignore$ file does not support wildcards in filenames, ie. You need to 
list all files and directories that you want to exclude in the directory of the 
$DoxyS.ignore$ file. The name of this file can be configured via the IGNORE_FILE_NAME 
in the config file, see InputOptions.

It's quite simple to use. In every directory where You need to exclude certain files 
or subdirectories simple create a $DoxyS.ignore$ file listing the files and directories 
to be excluded like this:

\code
some_directory_to_exclude
some_file_to_exclude.h
some_file_to_exclude.cpp
\endcode

! Excluding sections in files (DOXYS_OFF)
To turn of DoxyS parsing (text is skipped completely by pre-processor) 
type this on a single line in the source file outside any (other) 
documentation blocks.

!To turn OFF:
||/// DOXYS_OFF


!To turn ON:
||/// DOXYS_ON

When DoxyS is turned off, this state continues until the $/// DOXYS_ON$
statement is encountered or until the end of the file is reached. Ie. there
is an implicit "turn on" statement at the end of a file.

! Using the exclude command
A single entity can be excluded by using the \\exclude command, see excludeCmd.
