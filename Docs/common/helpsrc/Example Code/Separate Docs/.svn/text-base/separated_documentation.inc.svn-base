!Separated documentation
This entity is documented in a separate file #$separated_documentation.dxd$# 
and not as normally in the code right next to the definition or declaration. 
Use this way of documenting if you prefer to have no DoxyS comments in your 
source code. (By the way this text is included from $separated_documentation.inc$ 
using the \\include command, see includeCmd)
