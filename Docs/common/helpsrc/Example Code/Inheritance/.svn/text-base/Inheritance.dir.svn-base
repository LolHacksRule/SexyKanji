/**
\dir 
!! Overridden functions + class diagrams demonstration.
This directory contains a simple class hierachy to show how the class inheritance 
and collaboration diagrams can look like and how overridden functions are displayed.

Also the "Show all inherited" icon on the top of the "Public"-tab and "Protected"-tab 
is demonstrated.
