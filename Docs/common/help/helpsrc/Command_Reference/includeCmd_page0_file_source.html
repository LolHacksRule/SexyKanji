/**
\page includeCmd
!!!Including a file with additional documentation
This command can be used to include a source file as a block of code. The command 
takes the name of an include file as an argument. DoxyS will look for the file relative 
to the current directory. Absolute path's may also be specified.

Beware that one }should not} enclose the text in the include file with $/**, \endds_doc$ 
as the file is included raw as it is.
!Syntax
\code
\include <include_file_name>
\endcode
!Output
The included text is treated excately as if it where written in place.
\note The DoxyS documentation uses $.inc$ as extension for include files. But this 
is just our convention and any file name will work.
