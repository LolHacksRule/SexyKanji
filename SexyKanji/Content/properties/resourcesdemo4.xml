<!-- 
  All resources.xml files must contain the ResourceManifest section.

  Use the ResourceGenerator tool to convert this XML into C++ code.
  The variable names that you give to the resources below will then be
  accessible by any file that includes your generated resource header file.

  Resource groups can be loaded/deleted at any time. Thus, it's advantageous
  to split your resources into groups if you don't need to have every single
  resource in memory at the same time.

<ResourceManifest>
  
  <!-- 
    You create resource groups with the Resources tag. Specify the
		group name in the "id" field. We tend to use "Init" to mean the resources that
		must be loaded before ANYTHING displays. We put our main font in here instead
		of in the TitleScreen group (below) because we want the font to stick around
		for the duration of the game and not to be removed when we get rid of the
		title screen. -->
  <Resources id="Init">
    <!-- 
      You can set the default directory to look for the resources in, as
			well as a standard prefix for the resource variable names when the C++
			code is generated. -->
		<SetDefaults path="fonts" idprefix="FONT_" />
      <!-- 
        The Font tag indicates that we want to load and initialize a font. Just
			  give the font a name (in this case, FONT_DEFAULT) and tell the manager 
        where to look for the data file. -->
  		<Font id="DEFAULT"		          path="Huxtable20.xml"/>

      <!-- 
        The Image tag specifies that we want to load an image.
			  There is also a Music tag for loading music. All the tags work exactly the same:
			  you specify a variable name to use (if idprefix is specified it is prepended to
			  that name) and the name of the file to load. -->
		<SetDefaults path="images" idprefix="IMAGE_" />
	  	<Image id="CUSTOM_POINTER"	    path="custom_pointer"/>
		  <Image id="CUSTOM_HAND"			    path="custom_hand"/>

    These are the resources that are going to be used solely by the title screen.
		Again, we could have named this resource group anything we wanted.
		These resources will be deleted after we are done using the title screen. -->

    And finally, we'll put all the resources that are needed for the main game
		part of things in this group. -->
